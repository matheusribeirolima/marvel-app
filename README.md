## Tools 🔨

This project was built in Kotlin and designed according to the MVVM and Clean architectures using:

- **ViewModel:** The [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- **LiveData:** [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
- **Coroutines:** [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) not only open the doors to asynchronous programming, but also provide a wealth of other possibilities such as concurrency, actors, etc.
- **Dagger Hilt:** [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
- **Material Components:** [Material Components](https://material.io/components) are interactive building blocks for creating a user interface.
- **Navigation:** [Android Jetpack's Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- **Paging:** The [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
- **Retrofit:** A [type-safe HTTP client](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for Android and the JVM
- **Coil:** [Image loading](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Mockk:** [Mocking library](https://mockk.io) for Kotlin
